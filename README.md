# DiffSentry

DiffSentry is an open-source platform designed to support and secure the open source ecosystem through two core features: transaction rounding for donations and vulnerability scanning.

## Overview

DiffSentry creates a sustainable support system for open source projects by:
1. Rounding up financial transactions and directing the difference to open source projects
2. Providing automated security scanning to identify vulnerabilities in repositories

## Features

### Transaction Rounding & Donations

DiffSentry allows users to:
- Connect their payment accounts securely
- Round up transactions to the nearest dollar (or other unit)
- Direct the spare change to open source projects of their choice
- Track their contribution history and impact
- Set monthly donation limits and preferences

This creates a sustainable funding model for critical open source projects that form the backbone of our digital infrastructure.

### Vulnerability Scanning

Our security features include:
- Automated code scanning to detect common vulnerabilities
- Regular scans of connected repositories
- Detailed reports highlighting security issues
- Prioritization of vulnerabilities based on severity
- Suggestions for remediation steps
- Integration with common development workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
