# Transaction Rounding & Donations

This document provides detailed information about DiffSentry's transaction rounding feature.

## How It Works

DiffSentry connects to your payment accounts and monitors transactions. When a purchase is made, the amount is rounded up to the nearest dollar (or your selected unit), and the difference is set aside for donation.

### Example

If you make a purchase of $3.45:
- The transaction is rounded up to $4.00
- The difference of $0.55 is collected for donation
- At the end of your specified period, these collected funds are donated to your selected open source projects

## Setting Up Transaction Rounding

### Connecting Payment Methods

DiffSentry supports connecting various payment methods:
- Credit/debit cards
- Bank accounts
- Digital wallets (PayPal, Venmo, etc.)

We use industry-standard encryption and never store your full payment details.

### Selecting Beneficiary Projects

You can choose from our curated list of open source projects or suggest new ones for inclusion. Projects are categorized by:
- Technology area (web frameworks, databases, etc.)

### Configuring Donation Preferences

Customize your donation settings:
- Maximum monthly donation amount
- Rounding precision (nearest dollar, nearest 50Â¢, etc.)
